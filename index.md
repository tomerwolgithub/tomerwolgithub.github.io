# About

I am a PhD student at the Blavatnik School of Computer Science of Tel Aviv University. My PhD advisors are [Prof. Daniel Deutch](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~danielde/) and [Prof. Jonathan Berant](http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~joberant/). I am also serving as a research intern at the [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org/ai2-israel/).   

My area of research lies at the intersection of Data Management and Natural Language Processing. I am interested in developing algorithms that are capable of understanding complex questions over a multitude of domains, and to endow them with an ability to justify and explain their results.  

Prior to my PhD, I received my BSc and MSc in computer science at Tel Aviv University, under the supervision of Prof. Daniel Deutch.
